# Design Principle: FACADE

Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### Makes an interface simpler.

### To use the Facade Patter, we create a class that simplifies and unifies a set of more complex classes that belong to some subsystem.
