### Design Principle: 

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, lets the algotithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separete them from what stays the same.

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.

- Favor composition over inheritance.
