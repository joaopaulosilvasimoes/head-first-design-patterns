# Design Principle: DECORATOR

Attaches additional responsabilities to an object dynamically. Decorator provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Decorator patterns allow a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. So, there is no change to the original class. The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern, which provides a wrapper to the existing class.
